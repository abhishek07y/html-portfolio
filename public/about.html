<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Abhishek Bharti, a B.Tech 1st-year student at BIT Mesra, with a deep interest in web development and software technologies. Since the beginning of my journey in the world of programming, I have been fascinated by how websites and applications function behind the scenes. This curiosity has driven me to explore various technologies and frameworks that power the web today.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and diving into front-end frameworks like React.js while also getting familiar with back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases. My goal is to become a full-stack web developer, capable of building scalable, responsive, and user-friendly web applications..</p>

<p>Apart from coding, I enjoy solving problems, working on hands-on projects, and continuously challenging myself to improve my skills. Whether it’s designing an intuitive UI, optimizing website performance, or understanding server-side logic, I love every aspect of the development process.

  At BIT Mesra, I actively engage in learning new programming concepts, collaborating with peers, and participating in coding challenges and hackathons. I believe that continuous learning and practical experience are the keys to mastering web development.
  
  I’m always open to collaborations, learning opportunities, and exciting projects that help me grow as a developer. If you’re passionate about technology like me or have an interesting idea to work on, feel free to connect with me!.</p>
